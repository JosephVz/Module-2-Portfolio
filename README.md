# Module 2 Portfolio

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?

    This project helped me test my skills with all that i've learned in one week in order to build a website with lots o different features.
    This will help me further my expertise in this field to hopefully have something to show future employers.

- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")

    The answer to this question is similar to before. This project helped me get a grasp on what its like to build a website from scratch and use the skills learned.
    This helped me get a grasp on css and html as a whole.

- What problem does it solve?

    This project helps me put together someones vision into reality, in this case it was my own vision. In the future if someone asks
    me to build a website with certain features, i hope in the future i'll have the ability to do so.

- What did you learn?

    This project helped me get a better grasp on the structure of css and html. This project especially helped me realize how i myself write code
    as everyone has different ways of writing, i now understand what habits i have and how i can use them.

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.
