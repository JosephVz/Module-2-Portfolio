            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My name is Joseph and i have joined UNCC Charlotte's bootcamp for a chance at a new career. 
                I used to work at Piedmont Well Covers which they treated me well but over time i started
                to hate physical work more and more, i couldnt stand coming home tired everyday so thats
                how i ended up here today. Below this section you'll see my previous work as well as this
                whole website myself as my first few introductions to coding.

            <h2>Work</h2>
            <p>The picture above (left) is an example of the first website i have worked on.
                If you click on it, it should bring you to the website itself so you can inspect its code.

        <section class="">
            <h2>Experience</h2>
            <p>This website itself and everything on it was only created with one week of experience.
                I hope to look back on this website one day and either upgrade or reference my change in skill and knowledge.
